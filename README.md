# articleGeneratorModel

## About the model

The model generates a article based on given title.

## How to try the model

Just provide an title to the model and it will generate a whole article about it.

```python
# Install transformers library
!pip install transformers
```

```python
# Load tokenizer and model
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, TFAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
model_name = "Seungjun/articleGeneratorV1.0"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = TFAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

```python
# Get the article for a given title
from transformers import pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, framework="tf")
summarizer(
    "Steve Jobs", # title
    min_length=500,
    max_length=1024,
)
```

## Limitations

As now 99% of the context generated by the model is fake

## How the model was created

Fine-tuned t5-small model with a custom dataset uisng KerasNLP
Created a custom dataset using wikipedia data downloaded from kaggle. The csv file has 3 columns(id, prompt, articke) and 20K rows. 
The model was trained to generate article based on given prompt(the title)
