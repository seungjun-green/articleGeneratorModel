# articleGeneratorModel

## About the model

Just provide an title to the model and it will generate a whole article about it (up to 1024 tokens).

Find the model on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Seungjun/articleGeneratorV1.0)

## How to try the model

```python
# Install transformers library
!pip install transformers
```

```python
# Load tokenizer and model
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, TFAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
model_name = "Seungjun/articleGeneratorV1.0"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = TFAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

```python
# Get the article for a given title
from transformers import pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, framework="tf")
summarizer(
    "Steve Jobs", # title
    min_length=500,
    max_length=1024,
)
```

## Limitations

° As of now 99% of the context generated by the model is not true. 
° Model is so slow, takes great amount of time(~ 3 minutes) to generate a one article. 

## How the model was created

° Fine-tuned t5-small model with a custom dataset uisng KerasNLP
° Created a custom dataset(csv file) using wikipedia articles to have 3 columns(id, prompt, articke) and about 19K rows.
° The prompt is the title of the article, and during the procedure it wa given as inout and trained to predict the article

## Example of the training data

| ID      | Prompt               | Article                                                                                                                             |
